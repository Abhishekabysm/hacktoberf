# üìú Contribution Guidelines

We are excited to have you contribute during Hacktoberfest 2024. To ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for everyone, please follow these guidelines:

## üí° General Guidelines

- **Valid Contributions Only**: All contributions should be meaningful and in line with the repository's purpose. Pull Requests (PRs) that do not add value‚Äîsuch as adding empty files, updating minor typos, or making insignificant changes‚Äîwill not be accepted.
- **Maintain Code Quality**: Ensure that your code is clean, well-documented, and follows the best practices of the programming language you are using. Poorly written code or submissions with errors will be marked as invalid.
- **Be Respectful and Kind**: We welcome contributors of all experience levels. Please be considerate and supportive of each other. Respect the work of your fellow contributors, and engage in constructive discussions.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

We have a structured directory system to keep the repository organized:

- Each programming language has its own folder, such as `Java`, `Kotlin`, `React Native`, `Python`, etc.
- If you are contributing a project or code in a new language not already present, feel free to create a new directory for it. Use the language name as the folder name, such as `Go` or `C#`.
- Keep your projects and contributions within the relevant folder. For example, if you are contributing a Python project, place it in the `Python` folder.

This structure helps maintain order and ensures that future contributors can easily find and collaborate on projects.
